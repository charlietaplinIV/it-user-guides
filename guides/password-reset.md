## Tips & Common Pitfalls
- New password must adhere to your organization’s complexity and history rules.
- If you are locked out or forget your old password, contact your IT help desk to unlock your account or perform a manual reset.
- After resetting a domain password, you may need to reconnect VPN or sign out of other devices.
- For local accounts without admin rights, you cannot reset using Ctrl+Alt+Delete; use an admin account or recovery tools.
